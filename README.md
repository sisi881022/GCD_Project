Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===============================

This project analyzed the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI.

## Files

The repo includes the following files:

 - "README.md"
 - "run_analysis.R" : the R script to cleaning and writing tidy dataset
 - "Code_book.md" : the code book which describes the raw data and the tidy data set

## Data processing

The requirements and steps for this project:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## Results

A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
